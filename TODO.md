# Ideas

### Final thoughts:

This small app is pretty much done. The only thing that comes to mind is a refactor and some frontend additions, but that is optional

### Interesting addition:

The coding sub-section could be expanded by a few examples.

An interesting coding challenge is the spiral matrix. It's been added as class and the test runs fine, but there is no visual implementation yet.

There is a working JSON call to the spiral method.
