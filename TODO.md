# Ideas

### Final thoughts:

This small app is pretty much done. The only thing that comes to mind is a refactor and some frontend additions, but that is optional

### Interesting addition:

The coding sub-section could be expanded by a few examples. One of them being another biggest winnings/split-array example with shorter code and possibly a 'time-computed' method to show performance differences between different coding approaches.
