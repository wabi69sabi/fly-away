# Ideas

### Final thoughts:

This small app is pretty much done. The only thing that comes to mind is a refactor and some frontend additions, but that is optional

### Interesting addition:

The coding sub-section could be expanded by a few examples.

One additional coding example could be a nested loop that determines possible score combinations of full integers.
