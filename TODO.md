# Ideas

### A db:

A small db build with sqlite3 could be nice addition to this project.

A Rakefile and possibly a seed would be helpful. Testing could also be run as a rake task then.

### DB Models:

A good test model would be having a new route in the coding dropdown menu that let's the user send different queries and depending on a flag write them to or read them from the DB. The model could be named Query.
